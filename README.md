### peaceduke-discord-bot
# This is the repository representing the code of PeaceDuke the Discord bot, originally made for the server Correction Fluid.

PeaceDuke - is a Discord bot, that has a-sorta-advanced-but-actually-mediocre music playing system, lets you play minigames with others, moderate your server and other stuff.
PeaceDuke is developed by me, redhauser.

# How to start it up:
I recommend starting it using:

**env YTDL_NO_UPDATE=1 node .**
