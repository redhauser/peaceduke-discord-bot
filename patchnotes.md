# Patch notes (for self)

## Update 1.3 new features:

Brand new leveling system, prefix command interace has been made to look much better and more commands now support the prefix interface.
The /queue command has been slightly redesigned.

## Patch 1.3.1-1.3.7 new features:

Compared to the 1.3 update, now **ALL** commands actually support the prefix interface. In the 1.3 update, only a few commands were actually reworked to work with the prefix interface, the actual change was that all commands looked better in the prefix interface due to them not using the message.reply() method. 

Few abandoned and near to useless commands have been deleted, with examples such as: "/pay", "/rules", "/soundpad".
"/soundpad" has been removed due to it been almost never used and also even when used, it wouldn't work half the time.
The media/soundpad has been removed accordingly.

The media folder now only has vital documents.

"/plist" also has been removed, to be brought back in the next major update. It was removed due to how terrible it was worked, caused many file-saving problems, and other issues.

The "about" command has been overhauled.

node_modules is no longer being commited to the cloud, saving precious time and space.

The bot now leaves the voice channel when everyone else has left that voice channel.

Updated the /stats command, should be more consistent and less buggy now.

/play and /plnow also have been overhauled.

/play and /plnow commands should cause less lag than before.

All of the commands' lines have been revisioned

/plist has been remade, and instead of saving the entire fucking return value from (ytdl.getInfo) it actually only saves the urls, which doesn't require fucking JSON BigInt bypasses. Also its use interface has been entirely overhauled.

Even though /plist is well and working now, I won't be adding it in Patch 1.3.6. Instead, it's gonna go in the 1.4 Update, to make the update more grand. Yeah, I'm a bitch.

Updated all the logging messages to be more readable and to be more grammatically correct.

Removed all the random console.logs that I forgot to remove while debugging.

Slightly updated the to-do list.

Slightly updated README.md.

Also I'm thinking of removing patch notes......????

Because just what IF somebody reads all this shit....??? And that person IS NOT ME????!!!!

I think that's it...?
